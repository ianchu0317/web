## This project

This is a simulation to visualize the elevator algorithm of a building. It consists of a panel wich has four pairs of leds on it. Each pair (red, yellow) the status of a specific floor: the red led indicate the stop of the elevator and the yellow the floor wich it is. So for example if the elevator is stopped on floor three, then both leds will light up.

The project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/ianchu0317/Micro-Lift/).

There is also an explanation and demostration [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjsFHzDikcw&ab_channel=IanChen).
