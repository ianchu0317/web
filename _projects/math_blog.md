## This project

This is a [math blog](https://ianchu0317.github.io/analisis-matematico-ii/) for the course "Analisis Matem√°tico II" of University of Buenos Aires. It has my own resolutions of the exercises given by the professors and some theory videos to help visualize the content.

The blog content is divided by the differents units this course has.

Also interface is very intuitive thanks to the cayman blog for Jekyll and Github Pages.
