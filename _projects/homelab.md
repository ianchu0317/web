## Purpose and Objectives

I use my homelab to serve backups of photos and files, hosting deploys of my projects, practice linux configurations without breaking anything (create VM for testing), host my own VPN server, my minecraft server, and more.

---

## Things I've learned
Through this process of setting up my homelab I've gained a lot of experience and hand-on practices like:
- Linux system configuration
- User creation, configuration and permissions
- Backup and automation of systems and servers
- Networking and routing configuration
- How to set up firewall
- Docker deploy of services
- Deploy of projects
- How to use Proxmox 
- Domain customization
- Technical documentation


## Future learning
In the future I know I'll keep expanding my setup: I want to install some NAS for my files and also better CPU and Network performance. 

Some topics to practice in the future are:
- Active directory configuration
- Modeling enterprise network
- Firewall configuration
- Custom Router configuration (pfsense)
- Kubernetes cluster

## History
I've started my homelab with an intel nuc i3 to backup my photos from my phone to a physical HDD drive.

Later it just kept expanding. Its like an adiction ðŸ˜¨
