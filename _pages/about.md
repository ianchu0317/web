If I had to describe myself with one word, it would be _curious_. 

Since I was a kid I like to learn and try new things, and so I'm very self-taught. 
A lot of skills I have are from watching videos online and practicing by myself. I think I'm really good at it.

I've started learning _Programming_ and _Networking_ at the age of 14. And this year (2025) I realized that I really enjoy doing SysAdmin tasks, such as setting up networks, configuring servers, etc. So nowdays I spend a lot of time setting up and building my Homelab and doing projects. Always trying new things. 

In my free time I like to play instruments, watch videos about new technologies and **DIY** projects on Youtube. 

Iâ€™m looking forward to landing my first role in the tech industry, where I can apply my skills and keep learning.

I've built this website as my _portfolio_ to post my learning on the `/blog` section and document my projects on the `/projects` :)
